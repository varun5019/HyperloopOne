        <h1 class="head-style-2" >NOV 16 2017</h1>
        <h2 style="color: #333">Virgin Hyperloop One signs MOU in India with the Government of Maharashtra to conduct its Preliminary Study</h2>
       <p>
      Mumbai, India, November 16, 2017— Virgin Hyperloop One today announced its partnership with the Government of Maharashtra with an intent to conduct a preliminary study in the region. The US-based company signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Pune Metropolitan Region Development Authority (PMRDA) to identify potential routes and analyze the high-level economic impact and technical viability of hyperloop transportation solutions in India.
    </p>
    <p>
      Virgin Hyperloop One will work with its partners in the region and the PMRDA will help navigate the regulatory requirements and support the report with data. The preliminary study is intended to analyse the applicability and benefits of hyperloop technology, identify high priority routes within the State based on demand analysis and socio-economic benefits, and inform the Government of Maharashtra in any future decision to progress to the full project stage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Virgin Hyperloop One will improve economic competitiveness, reduce congestion and emissions, and provide citizens with greater social and economic mobility. As it is the only company in the world that has built and successfully tested a full-scale hyperloop system, there is a growing demand for a hyperloop from governments and the private sectors around the world. Apart from India, Virgin Hyperloop One is working on projects in countries like the UAE, U.S., Canada, Finland, and the Netherlands.
    </p>
    <p>
      “A hyperloop route requires high-density traffic to become viable as a means of rapid public transit. Mumbai and Pune, the most and seventh most populous cities in India respectively, have the potential to provide an optimal route with a high density,” said Hon. Chief Minister of Maharashtra, Shri. Devendra Fadnavis. “By reducing travel time to under 20 minutes, a hyperloop route will help intensify the connectivity between the metropolitan regions of Pune and Mumbai, transforming the two cities into India’s first and largest Megapolis,” he added.
    </p>
    <p>
      Looking at the present traffic scenario in Mumbai, Virgin Hyperloop One can reinvent and transform transportation in Maharashtra as it redefines speed with minimal time consumption. A hyperloop solution could revolutionize the transport experience. For example:
    </p>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>It would take just 14-minutes to travel between Mumbai and the fast-growing city of Pune, a journey that currently takes up to 3 hours by car</li>
        <li>It could also streamline airport connectivity, such as connecting Pune’s new Purandar Airport to the city center or Navi Mumbai International Airport to Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport</li>
        <li>
          It could look at connecting Nagpur, which is in the easternmost part of Maharashtra, with Mumbai and Pune to vastly improve passenger and freight transportation
        </li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
     “To coincide with the Digital India initiative and the pivotal role that technology will play in it, Virgin Hyperloop One can be a key facilitator,” said Nick Earle, SVP Global Field Operations, Virgin Hyperloop One. “India has a proud track record of technological advancement by leapfrogging legacy solutions as illustrated by the successful national roll out of 3G and 4G networks. Hyperloop represents a leapfrog opportunity which will enable a dramatic reimagining of the complete transportation system,” he added. 
  </p>
  <p>
    India has been facing major transportation challenges. According to the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways, 65% of India’s freight is transported on the country’s strained and congested road networks. With speeds 2-3 times faster than high-speed rail, and being fully autonomous, hyperloop technology can deliver a 300-km commute in under 20 minutes and address many of these issues.
  </p>
  <p>
    "This preliminary study will help the Government of Maharashtra provide its citizens with a cleaner, safer, and faster mode of transportation,” said Harj Dhaliwal, Managing Director, Middle East & India, Virgin Hyperloop One. “Virgin Hyperloop One is the only company in the world that has successfully built and tested the first full-scale hyperloop system. With this report, the Government of Maharashtra will be able to identify viable routes that link commercial and knowledge hubs dispersed throughout the region with greater mobility and unparalleled efficiency,” he added.

        <h2 style="color: #333">Virgin Hyperloop One Appoints New Co-Executive Chairman And Vice Chairman To Board Of Directors</h2>
       <p>
           <b>NEW YORK, Oct. 18, 2017:</b> Following a strategic partnership with the Virgin Group, Virgin Hyperloop One, the only company in the world that has built and successfully tested a full-scale Hyperloop system, today announced the appointments of a new Co-Executive Chairman, Ziyavudin Magomedov, Chairman of the Summa Group, and Vice Chairman, Jim Rosenthal, the former COO of Morgan Stanley, to its board of directors.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We're privileged to have Ziyavudin appointed as Co-Executive Chairman and Jim join as Vice Chairman of the board of directors of Virgin Hyperloop One," said Shervin Pishevar, co-founder and Co-Executive Chairman of Virgin Hyperloop One. "In addition to Richard Branson joining the board, we have attracted and commanded the greatest minds to guide us as we position ourselves for global growth. Their proven leadership in their respective industries adds another dimension in helping us achieve our dream of bringing Virgin Hyperloop One technology to the world."
    </p>
    <p>
      As the Chairman of The Summa Group, a diversified private holding company with significant global investments in port logistics, engineering, construction, telecommunications, innovative technologies and the oil and gas sectors, Mr. Magomedov brings his vast expertise in logistics and infrastructure, which will be beneficial as Virgin Hyperloop One works with government and private sector partners to build out its freight and shipping capabilities. The Summa Group employs more than 25,000 people in almost 40 regions of Russia and abroad. Mr. Magomedov's Caspian VC Partners fund has been a strategic and early investor in Virgin Hyperloop One. He will share responsibilities with Shervin Pishevar as they lead the board as co-chairmen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Rosenthal brings his extensive experience in the financial sector, funding high growth companies, establishing solid governance and security policies. As the former COO of Morgan Stanley, Jim will help guide the company as it enters the commercialization phase of its product development. He is currently the co-founder and CEO of BlueteamGlobal, a cyber security company.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I am honored to be named Co-Executive Chairman of the board alongside Shervin," said Ziyavudin Magomedov. "As an early investor in Virgin Hyperloop One, I am impressed by the progress the company has achieved in such a short timeframe to design and build the technology and make Hyperloop real. Virgin Hyperloop One will create new opportunities in shipping and supply chain distribution while driving significant value for a variety of industries that reinvents transportation as we know it. I can visualize a next generation Silk Road connecting the world with Virgin Hyperloop One technology."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Both Ziyavudin and Jim join a board increasingly focused on global commercialization," said Rob Lloyd, CEO of Virgin Hyperloop One. "They join DP World Chairman HE Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem on our global board. DP World was an important early investor, and Sultan has been a passionate advocate for our business since DP World's first investment. He continues to help us cultivate relationships in the Middle East and in India. All three Directors bring tremendous value in terms of international business and government relationships and experience in scaling a global business."
    </p>
    <p>
     Last week, Virgin Hyperloop One announced a global strategic partnership with the Virgin Group to focus on passenger and mixed-use cargo service in addition to the creation of a new passenger division. Depending on the market, other brands could be used globally as well. Following the successful test at its "DevLoop" test track in Nevada this past summer, Virgin Hyperloop One continues to see a growing demand from governments and the private sector around the world with projects underway in the UAE, U.S., Canada, Finland, the Netherlands and India.
  </p>
  <p>
    With Virgin Hyperloop One, passengers and cargo are loaded into a pod, and accelerate gradually via electric propulsion through a low-pressure tube. The pod quickly lifts above the track using magnetic levitation and glides at airline speeds for long distances due to ultra-low aerodynamic drag. Virgin Hyperloop One's radically efficient and clean, all-electric technology is aligned with the Virgin Group's purpose-driven mission to deliver more sustainable modes of transportation.

      Senior Vice President of Hyperloop One’s Global Operations, Nick Earle, delivered the closing key note at the Global Manufacturing and Industrialisation Summit (GMIS) in Abu Dhabi today, bringing to light the transformative effect that Hyperloop One will have on manufacturing, logistics, supply chain and warehousing. The keynote, entitled ‘Hyperloop and Manufacturing – This Changes Everything,’ highlighted the ways in which the aforementioned sectors will benefit – including increased capital due to reducing finished goods inventories by 25%, access to 10 times larger talent pools with the same commute time and saving up to 80% on real estate costs, as well as shorter lead times, reduced freight spend and slashed CO2 emissions.
    </p>
    <p>
      “As the only company in the world building an operational Hyperloop system, Hyperloop One is focused on creating a new mode of transportation to move people and cargo,” said Earle. “Hyperloop One changes everything. We're committed to enabling disruption to create new opportunities in manufacturing, warehousing and supply chain distribution. Hyperloop will drive significant value for a wide range of businesses and reinvent transportation as we know it.”
    </p>
    <p>
     At two thirds the cost, three times the speed and with 3.5-4 times the benefit of high speed rail, Hyperloop will have a tangible impact on current and future businesses and society. Hyperloop will transform transportation, driving value throughout the ecosystem and enabling job creation, while also empowering workers with the ability to commute quickly and easily.

      The Hyperloop concept has generated excitement and interest from start-ups around the world since it was first proposed in 2013. While other start-ups have not yet moved beyond basic research, Hyperloop One is the only company that is building a functional Hyperloop system. Following the successful public demonstration of the propulsion motor in May 2016 Hyperloop One is on track to run the world’s first full-system test in 2017 in Nevada

      “Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s vision for transforming India and the role he sees of technology in driving this change is indeed remarkable,” said Shervin Pishevar, Executive Chairman of Hyperloop One. “India is an extremely important geography for developing Hyperloop networks and reimagining how cities and regions work. The Prime Minister’s vision of connecting the country is directly aligned with Hyperloop One’s objective of connecting the world. With initiatives such as ‘Make In India’ and ‘Digital India’, we do see ourselves working in this direction in India.”

      “Hyperloop One will help accelerate India’s growth towards building substantial infrastructure that is both financially and environmentally sustainable,” said Rob Lloyd, CEO of Hyperloop One. “A transportation system like the Hyperloop will undoubtedly ease the pressure on existing infrastructure while enhancing the quality of life of the people. We are already working with the governments around the world on passenger and freight projects, and we look forward to also partnering with India to support this endeavour.”

     The Hyperloop One Vision For India summit also showcased five Hyperloop One Global Challenge (HOGC) semi-finalist teams from India, each of which proposed high-speed transportation routes that could improve the lives of millions of Indian citizens. The HOGC required the teams to develop regional proposals integrating Hyperloop One's disruptive transport technology to move passengers and freight from point-to-point, swiftly, and on-demand.

      The HOGC which was kicked off in May 2016 invited teams across the world to put forward a comprehensive and commercially viable transport plan covering economical and policy aspects of their respective cities, regions and countries. The HOGC received more than 2,600 registrants from 90 countries, and narrowed the field down to 35 semi-finalists across all continents with a potential pipeline worth $26 billion. India led the way with the highest number of registrants and had the most vocal supporters of Hyperloop One on social media. The India semi-finalists include:
